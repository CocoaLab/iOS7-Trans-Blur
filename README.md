iOS7-Trans-Blur
===============

Implementation of the new iOS7-style masking transparency blur, using StackBlur

First off, big thanks to tomsoft1 for the iOS implementation of [StackBlur](https://github.com/tomsoft1/StackBluriOS).
I used this as my base, with manual animation and masking, to produce high quality masking blur similar to what you see in the new iOS.

Ironically this was made months and months ago for a project which never took off, but I'm sure people are looking for something similar right about now!

Enjoy, and feel free to email and fix anything I'm screwing up!

**NOTE
The code is not well commented yet, and is on the heavier/lower side of things, so hang out and you'll see this get better-explained over the next few days
